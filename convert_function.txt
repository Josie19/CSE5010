CONVERT(G):
1. Let k be the number of states of G.
2. If k = 2, then G must consist of a start state, an accept state, and a single
arrow connecting them and labeled with a regular expression R.
Return the expression R.
3. If k > 2, we select any state qrip ∈ Q different from qstart and qaccept and let
G0 be the GNFA (Q0
, Σ, δ0
, qstart, qaccept), where
Q
0 = Q − {qrip},
and for any qi ∈ Q0 − {qaccept} and any qj ∈ Q0 − {qstart}, let
δ
0
(qi
, qj ) = (R1)(R2)
∗
(R3) ∪ (R4),
for R1 = δ(qi
, qrip), R2 = δ(qrip, qrip), R3 = δ(qrip, qj ), and R4 = δ(qi
, qj ).
4. Compute CONVERT(G0
) and return this valu
